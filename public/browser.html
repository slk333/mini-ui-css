                <div class="secondaryText">Published 3 hours ago by Antoine Weber</div>

                <p>
                    I mainly practice on Adobe Illustrator, the leading vector-drawing software,
                    where I can draw anything, from simple shapes to complex compositions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I like Illustrator because I can interact and play with the graphic design
                    primitives (shapes, curves, colors, fonts..) in an intuitive and easy way. I
                    then try combinations and iterate. This gives way to infinite possibilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As of now, I know the main shortcuts and I understand the main Illustrator
                    tools. But I'm still far from mastering it, and more importantly, what to do
                    with it once I master it.
                </p>
                <h3>Design interest</h3>
                <p>
                    I want to be better at design because I need this skill for crafting attractive
                    user-interfaces (UI), for websites or applications. I do also enjoy creating
                    artworks and sharing them (as most people).
                </p>
                <p>
                    After getting familiar with the basics, I quickly got tangible results: In
                    real-life, when looking at a designed item, such as a logo, a street sign, an
                    artwork, or any writing, I can see more things, I'm more interested, I interpret
                    details and I may guess the designer intent.
                </p>
